  title: 🔑 Radicale-Docker, Docker image for Radicale calendar and contact server + security 🔐 + addons 🚀
  image: /assets/images/projects/docker-radicale_banner.png
  description: >-
    [docker-radicale](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/) is a Docker image
    for [Radicale](https://radicale.org), a simple Calendar and Contacts server, featuring:
      * **a non-root user**,
      * **a read-only filesystem**,
      * **reduced privileges**,
      * **multi-architecture support**,
      * and some convenience features after all!
    
      Initially, I started self-hosting services on a virtual server (running OpenBSD, yay!).  
    Then I switched to my own hardware, and I wanted to run Radicale in a Docker container, with **security** in mind.
    
      This project taught me a lot about **OpenSource** and "the cost of contribution".  
    Contributions are welcome, but they also push the project to support features I don't use, which makes me question the maintenance months later. 🤔

  description: >-
    [Fynodoro](https://github.com/tomsquest/fynodoro) is a timer **widget** designed to stay on your screen all the time.  
      It takes up a tiny bit of screen space and can be set to nearly transparent.  
      When you need to focus, you can start a Pomodoro timer with a single click. A notification will remind you when the time is up.
    
      I use it daily to get in the flow, to monitor dedicated time, and during pair-programming sessions to switch the keyboard.
    
      Tips: place it on the side of your screen, nearly transparent, without window decoration, and always on top.

      However, typing can get tricky when MyPy and functional programming clash! 😅  
    And it becomes even more fun when everything turns into an IO of Task of Either of Option. 😜

    It was amusing to see that the stemmers, like the French one, have some issues, but they solve 90% of the cases with just a few lines of code.

    We were playing on 56K modems, and we were proud of it! Bad pings, dropped packets, and we still managed to win some games.  
    
      The website contained a very popular list of hiding places, 
      ballistics of all weapons and their rank per accuracy/power,
      but also my keybindings and config for the game.
    
      I made the website in **pure HTML** using `<table>` for layout! Yes, I didn't know div existed. 😅
