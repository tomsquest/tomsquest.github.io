  image: /assets/images/projects/docker-radicale_banner.png
  description: >-
    [docker-radicale](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale/) is a Docker image
    for [Radicale](https://radicale.org), a simple Calendar and Contacts server, featuring:
      * **a non-root user**,
      * **a read-only filesystem**,
      * **reduced privileges**,
      * **multi-architecture support**,
      * and some convenience features after all!
    
      Initially, I started self-hosting services on a virtual server (running OpenBSD, yay!).  
    Then I switched to my own hardware, and I wanted to run Radicale in a Docker container, with **security** in mind.
    
      This project taught me a lot about **OpenSource** and "the cost of contribution".  
    Contributions are welcome, but they also push the project to support features I don't use, which makes me question the maintenance months later. ü§î

  description: >-
    [Fynodoro](https://github.com/tomsquest/fynodoro) is a timer **widget** designed to stay on your screen all the time.  
      It takes up a tiny bit of screen space and can be set to nearly transparent.  
      When you need to focus, you can start a Pomodoro timer with a single click. A notification will remind you when the time is up.
    
      I use it daily to get in the flow, to monitor dedicated time, and during pair-programming sessions to switch the keyboard.
    
      Tips: place it on the side of your screen, nearly transparent, without window decoration, and always on top.
