Last week I ran an **"Intellij Master Championship"** class/presentation. There were prizes to win, like Jetbrains Yoyos, Intellij Stickers.

We had a great time sharing tips and counting points to nominate the "best-intellij-touch-typist-2k17".

The rules were one point by valid answer and each player answers secretly then the answer is given before I show it on screen and discuss it.

If you would like to run the presentation, the html is here: https://tomsquest.github.io/intellij-master-presentation/

The PDF of the shortcuts is at: https://github.com/tomsquest/intellij-master-presentation/blob/master/SHORTCUTS.pdf

And the whole source is on [github](https://github.com/tomsquest/intellij-master-presentation).
