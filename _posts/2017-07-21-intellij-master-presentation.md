Last week I ran an **"Intellij Master Championship"** class/presentation. There were prizes to win, like Jetbrains Yoyos, Intellij Stickers.

We had great time-sharing tips and counting points to nominate the "best-intellij-touch-typist-2k17".

The rules were one point by valid answer, and each player answers secretly then the answer is given before I show it on screen and discuss it.
