Learn how to set up a secure, monitored backup system using [Restic](https://restic.net/) and [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/).   
This guide covers running Restic without root privileges, automating backups and cleanup, and getting notifications when things go right‚Äîor wrong.

## TL;DR

Most interesting bits:
- Run Restic rootless
- Alerts by SMS and email with [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/)
- Full log sent by email

## Restic Rootless

Given you want to backup some system folders, like `/etc`, `/home`, and so on, you may want to run Restic without giving it full access to your system.  
The old solution would have been to run the software as `root`, or setting the `setuid` bit on the binary. 
This is **dangerous**, as the attacker would have full access to your system, in **write** mode!  

The solution comes from Restic documentation in the ["Backing up your system without running restic as root"](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/080_examples.html#backing-up-your-system-without-running-restic-as-root) section.

The solution boils down to:
- Create a new user, `restic`
- Put the `restic` binary in `$HOME/restic`
- Ensure restic and root own the binary
- Add the read capability to the binary

I will not repeat the instructions here, as they are very well documented in the link above.

Notice: any update to the `restic` binary requires to re-set the capability.

## Running Restic

I have two scripts that are run by systemd timers: one for backup, one for prune.

Prune is to remove old backups, i.e. the ones that are not needed anymore (like if you keep only the last 7 days).

### Create the bucket

Depending on whom you use as a storage provider, you may need to create a bucket.
This is pretty straightforward, and you can follow the documentation of your provider.

In my case, I use [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com) Object Storage, and I created a bucket named `my-bucket`.
The provided will give you a key, a secret, and a URL to access the bucket.

### Credentials

The repository and credentials are stored in `/home/restic/restic-env.sh`:

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="MY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="MY_KEY"
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY="s3:https://s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/my-bucket"
export RESTIC_PASSWORD="MY_PASSWORD"
```

### Backup

The `/home/restic/backup.sh` will:
- backup the files according to the includes and excludes
- check some parts of the backups for errors (a percentage of the data)
- display the list of files that have changed since the last backup
- the duration of each operation

```shell
#!/bin/bash
  
set -euo pipefail

function secondsToHuman {
  local startTime="$1"
  local now=$(date +'%s')
  local elapsed=$((now - startTime))
  echo "$(( elapsed / 3600 ))h $(( (elapsed / 60) % 60 ))m $(( elapsed % 60 ))s"
}

function backup {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Backup starting... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/restic backup -v \
    --exclude-file=/home/restic/restic-excludes.txt \
    --files-from=/home/restic/restic-includes.txt
  echo "## Done backup in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function check {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Check backups... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/restic check -v --read-data-subset=10%
  echo "## Done check in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function diffLatestSnapshot {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Computing diff of latest snapshots... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/diff-latest-snapshot.sh
  echo "## Done computing diff of latest snapshots in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function main {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')

  source /home/restic/restic-env.sh

  backup
  check
  diffLatestSnapshot

  echo "## All done in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime" ) seconds ‚úÖ"
}

main
```

The `restic-includes.txt` and `restic-excludes.txt` are lists of files to backup or exclude.

For instance, the `restic-includes.txt` could be:
```shell
/home/foo
/etc
```

And the `restic-excludes.txt` could be:
```shell
**/.cache
**/.local
```

### Prune

The `/home/restic/prune.sh` script is run once a month (not on each backup) and will:
- forget the snapshots according to the retention policy
- list the current (remaining) snapshots
- run the `check` command of restic

```shell
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

function secondsToHuman {
  local startTime="$1"
  local now=$(date +'%s')
  local elapsed=$((now - startTime))
  echo "$(( elapsed / 3600 ))h $(( (elapsed / 60) % 60 ))m $(( elapsed % 60 ))s"
}

function forget {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Forget snapshots... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/restic forget -v \
    --keep-last 28 \
    --keep-daily 30 \
    --keep-weekly 16 \
    --keep-monthly 24 \
    --prune
  echo "## Done forget in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function snapshots {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Snapshots starting... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/restic snapshots
  echo "## Done snapshots in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function check {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')
  echo "## Check backups... ‚û°Ô∏è"
  /home/restic/restic check
  echo "## Done check in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime") seconds"
}

function main {
  local startTime=$(date +'%s')

  source /home/restic/restic-env.sh

  forget
  snapshots
  check

  echo "## All done in $(secondsToHuman "$startTime" ) seconds ‚úÖ"
}

main
```

Note that there are some overlaps between the two scripts, feel free to make them yours.

## Scheduling

My server uses Systemd, so let us declare services and timers:
- one service and one time for `backup`
- one service and one time for `prune`

Create `/etc/systemd/system/backup.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Backup
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
OnFailure=notify-failure@%n.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=restic
ExecStart=/home/restic/backup.sh
ExecStopPost=/usr/local/bin/notify-unit backup.service "healthcheck-io-id-for-backup-abc12"

# Make /usr, /boot, /etc and possibly some more folders read-only.
ProtectSystem=full

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Note:
- The service is run as the `restic` user
- On end, we run a script to notify of success and failure, passing the service name and the ID of the healthcheck on Healthchecks.io (more on that below)
- On complete failure, we run another service to be notified of errors
- We protect the system folders from being written to (optional, but why not)

Here is the Timer, `/etc/systemd/system/backup.timer`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run Backup
Requires=backup.service

[Timer]
Unit=backup.service

OnCalendar=00:00
OnCalendar=13:00

# Run script given last scheduled run has been miss (reboot...)
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Note:
- Backup is run twice a day. I want to backup my work from the morning, and the work from the afternoon.
- The timer is `persistent`, so if the server is rebooted, the next backup will be run as soon as possible, i.e. not miss a backup.

The `prune` service and timer are similar.

In `/etc/systemd/system/prune.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Prune backups
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
OnFailure=notify-failure@%n.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=restic
ExecStart=/home/restic/prune.sh
ExecStopPost=/usr/local/bin/notify-unit prune.service "healthcheck-io-id-for-prune-efg567"

# Make /usr, /boot, /etc and possibly some more folders read-only.
ProtectSystem=full

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And in `/etc/systemd/system/prune.timer`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run Prune backups

[Timer]
Unit=prune.service

# Run the first monday of every month
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers
OnCalendar=*-*-01 01:00:00

# Run script given last scheduled run has been miss (reboot...)
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Note that pruning is run once a month, on the first Monday.  
The goal is to tidy the snapshots and keep only the one we want/need.

## Monitoring

I use [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) to monitor the success and failure of the backups and prunes.

The service is free for a limited number of checks, and I find it handy to be notified by email and SMS when something goes wrong.

Healthcheck.io works by adding "Checks" that get a URL to be pinged at the specified schedule. 
If the urls are not pinged, you get a notification.  
Simple + Efficient = Awesome!

In my case, I defined two checks, one for backup and one for prune.

## Notify success and errors

We will create two scripts in /usr/local/bin:
- one to collect the logs
- one to notify

The `/usr/local/bin/notify-unit` script will:
- collect the logs of the last run from the service, using `journalctl` and the service name specified as a param
- notify Healthcheck.io
- send an email with the logs

```shell
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

UNIT="$1"
HEALTHCHECKIO_ID="$2"

function sendEmail {
  local status=$1
  local icon=$2

  /usr/sbin/sendmail -t <<EOF
To: CHANGEME@CHANGEME.com
From: CHANGEME@CHANGEME.com
Subject: $icon $UNIT: $status
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

SERVICE_RESULT: $SERVICE_RESULT
EXIT_CODE: $EXIT_CODE

$(systemctl status --full "$UNIT")

----

$(journalctl -q _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=`systemctl show -p InvocationID --value $UNIT`)
EOF
}

if [ "$SERVICE_RESULT" = "success" ] && [ "$EXIT_STATUS" = "0" ]; then
  sendEmail "Success" "üíö"
  curl -fsS --retry 5 --max-time 10 -o /dev/null "https://hc-ping.com/$HEALTHCHECKIO_ID"
else
  sendEmail "Error" "‚õî" 
  curl -fsS --retry 5 --max-time 10 -o /dev/null "https://hc-ping.com/$HEALTHCHECKIO_ID/fail"
fi
```

The second script, `/usr/local/bin/notify-unit-failure`, is used when the Systemd service completely failed to run.

With some thinking, as my setup is working, maybe this one is redundant and could be removed.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

UNIT="$1"

/usr/sbin/sendmail -t <<EOF
To: CHANGEME@CHANGEME.com
From: CHANGEME@CHANGEME.com
Subject: ‚õî Systemd unit FAILED: $UNIT
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

$(systemctl status --full "$UNIT")

----

$(journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=`systemctl show -p InvocationID --value $UNIT`)
EOF
```

Note:
- You need a properly configured mail command (a `MTA`) to be able to send emails. I use `msmtp` under the hood, and use [MailJet](https://www.mailjet.com/) as a relay.
- You need to replace the emails with your own

### Success email sample üíö

## Conclusion

‚úÖ And there you have it: a backup system that runs without root, sends you alerts, and actually tells you when something's wrong. 

The setup might look like a lot of moving parts, but once it's running, you can finally stop worrying about backups and get back to breaking prod... I mean, being productive. üî•üßØ
