Some years ago, I found that using `alt-tab` for app switching was not that convenient nor fast.

I bounded some key to directly access the app I had in mind with great success in term of efficiency.

This has worked greatly but I think I can go a bit further.

**TL;DR**: Configure key-to-app with Jumpapp, experiment with single-key press

## Efficiency and Focus

Not being disturbed is the great idea here.

The desktop animation to switch from an app to an app is error prone and slow.

When I want to paste a StackOverflow to my code editor, I can copy, then **switch in one** key to the editor, then paste.
Want to search something, `Super-F1` and the browser appears.

No more, alt-tab once thinking I just left the editor before going to the browser, or was it two windows away.

No more, "aper√ßu" of all running applications through the App Switcher/Alt-tab menu, searching for something like a code editor.

## How-to

### Custom

I have used the following in Xfce to directly access my apps, bound to a key in Xfce:

```bash
sh -c "wmctrl -a jetbrains-idea -x || /home/tom/Apps/idea/current/bin/idea.sh"
```

It worked quite well, but it is not able to switch between apps **of the same type**.

### Jumpapp

Killer app for me. Jumpapp is a wrapper around wmctrl and makes it really easy to:

- switch directly to an app by its `WM_CLASS` or name
- switch between app of the same type
- open an instance of target app when not found

## Optimization

I will try in the coming weeks to use a **single** key to switch app.

The idea is to have a direct key to an app instead of a weird-two-fingers keybinging like `Super-F1`, which is not that much ergonomic on a standard keyboard or a laptop keyboard.

Here is what I will try:

- Press `F1` to switch to my browser, instead of `Super-F1`
- Press `F2` to switch to my terminal, instead of `Super-F2`
- Press `F3` to switch to my code editor, instead of `Super-F3`

This will cause conflict in some applications.

There is no problem for `F1` as it is the help screen, and can be skipped.

But, `F2` is bound to go to next error in Intellij. This is a key I used often.

Same for `F3` which is bound to next occurrence.

`F4` is also bounded, but to `Jump to source` which I don't think I use.

## Ideas

3 things:

- Some have used default keys like `MAIL` and `BROWSER` to access their app, which can also be convenient.
- There are some tutorials in the articles from [xahlee.info](http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_keyboard_tools.html)
- Using a launcher (I use [Albert](https://albertlauncher.github.io/) on Linux and it has a plugin to switch to windows) can work but it is more tedious
