<h2>Fynodoro, the Pomodoro Widget</h2>

<p>
  Fynodoro is a Pomodoro timer designed to stay on your screen all the time.
  It takes up a tiny bit of screen space and can be set to nearly transparent.
</p>
<p>
  I use it to monitor the time dedicated to a specific task ("Let's put a Pomodoro on that part of the code"),
  or during pair-programming sessions to switch the keyboard every 25 minutes.
  A notification at the end keeps me on track.
