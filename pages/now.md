## 2025

### July 2025

- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Dungeon Crawler Carl" vol 4(LitRPG genre). Entertaining!
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Le chevalier aux épines", vol 2. We are back with Benvenuto (the killer, no remorse), and that was excellent!
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> GenAI and Multi-modal models to improve Search engine relevance! Very promising!

### June 2025

- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Started reading a LitRPG series, a genre I did not know existed. Quite entertaining!
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Did the [Hugging Face Agents course](https://huggingface.co/agents-course). Nicely done. Agents are all the rage!
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> So much GenAI lately: generate configuration, guide users, classify queries...

### May 2025

- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Lots of Python for some GenerativeAI projects (and some pressure!)
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published [Best books on Search]({% post_url 2025-05-08-best-books-on-search %})
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read the last volume of “The Expanse” (vol. 9). A good sci-fi series
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Mon frère et moi". Good start, low end
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Un psaume pour les recyclés sauvages". I really liked that one! 
- <span class="tag">[audiobook]</span> Listened to "24 heures dans l'Egypte ancienne". Great, same as the story of the other book about antique Rome
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Started reading "Thinking fast and slow". Biases, we are full of quirks!

### April 2025

- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Did some Agent stuff (LangChain, LangGraph, SmolAgents). Smart what you can do with "just prompts" and a bit of code
- <span class="tag">[audiobook]</span> Listened to "24 Heures dans l'ancienne Athènes". Fascinating. The stories of 24 persons, one hour each. Top!
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published [Kibana _cat apis tips]({% post_url 2025-04-25-kibana-_cat-api-tips-for-elasticsearch %})
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published [Kibana most useful keyboard shortcuts]({% post_url 2025-04-21-kibana-most-useful-keyboard-shortcuts %})
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published all of my LinkedIn posts around Elastic here, with a bit more details
- <span class="tag">[audiobook]</span> Listened to "Thinking fast and slow" (french version). Tons of knowledge! Should read the paper version.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Bourbon Kid" 2. Still good. Blood, vampyres, Tarantino style.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Wilt 3". Fun!

### March 2025

- <span class="tag">[audiobook]</span> Read "Home Deus" by Yuval Noah Harari. Very intriguing on our future. And written in 2019, before major AI advancement. Wow!
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published [Enable Elastic Compression]({% post_url 2025-03-23-elasticsearch-enable-compression %})
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Les Data Sciences en 100 questions/réponses." I liked the overview, but it is not a learning book, more a checklist to summarize knowledge. I would have greatly appreciated some tips and tricks to make the answers more appealing.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Finished "Wilt 2"
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Assasynth" third volume. Short and sweet ! I want to read all the others.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Bourbon Kid" first volume. Like a Tarantino movie. The twist with vampyre was ok-ish, but had some fun!
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published [Streaming data from BigQuery with TypeScript, Fast!]({% post_url 2025-03-01-bigquery-streaming-typescript %})
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> [Wrote a plugin for AlbertLauncher to use WordReference](https://github.com/tomsquest/albert_plugin_wordreference)
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Finished "Code" by Charles Petzold: a blast! Lots of revelation. And also things add to build complex stuff (from a light to a computer). Amazing!

### February 2025

- <span class="tag">[code]</span> [Wrote a plugin for AlbertLauncher to launch Firefox bookmarks and history](https://github.com/tomsquest/albert_plugin_firefox_bookmarks) and added with favicons!
- <span class="tag">[life]</span> A week of holidays! Replenishing, but so fast back to work!
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Still reading "Code" by Charles Petzold when I have some time and energy. I learn a lot about complexity, tiny pieces making a whole.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read volume 1 and 2 of "La Belgariade" by David Eddings. A coworker told me it's better than "The Lord of the Ring." Somehow. And I forgot that I already read those 2 books a couple of years ago!

### January 2025

- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read "Druss la Légende" by David Gemmell. Very simple, as an Action/Fantasy book. I was expected more.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Did not finish "Wilt 2" because I had to return it to the library.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Stopped reading "Le Réseau Corneille" by Ken Follett. I was expecting history bits, but it's an action book, and the torture scenes were too much for me.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Finished Yann Le Cun "When the Machine learns". IA is so old and so new! The future will bring changes!
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published a [guide/post on Kopia + Scaleway + Object-lock for ransomware protection]({% post_url 2025-01-03-kopia-scaleway-object-lock %})

## 2024

### December 2024

- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Started reading "Code" by Charles Petzold. Mind-blowing so far! I am making links between electricity, and computers, and why the things are the way they are.
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Started reading Yann Le Cun "When the Machine learns". Interesting to see the history, the discoveries made.
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published my [full restic setup]({% post_url 2024-12-31-backup-restic-setup %})
- <span class="tag">[blog]</span> Published my [syncthing + restic backup setup]({% post_url 2024-12-30-syncthing-restic-backup-setup-2025 %})
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Full Kopia setup in place on my server with object-lock, retention policy, permission-less apikey
- <span class="tag">[book]</span> Read the second book of the "Les Enquêtes de la 25e Heure". Enjoyed it (answers!).
- <span class="tag">[audiobook]</span> Finished 3 audiobooks. 2 bad, 1 good. Running and biking help a lot. But no note means less memory.
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Tweaked Crowdsec to not ban my mobile phone. I think it may be related to Firefox doing making queries for favicon (favicon-16, favicon-32 and so on) that all get blocked by http-auth, then Crowdsec bans the IP
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Manage to find the correct bucket permission for Kopia to be able to extend the object-locks. I need to wait a couple of days to see if the Lifecycle policy does not drop everything eventually.
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Switched from FreshRss to [Miniflux](https://miniflux.net/) because the responsive part of FreshRss never worked well
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Played with [KuzuDB](https://kuzudb.com/), an embedded graph database. Tons of applications at work.
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Tried [Kopia](https://github.com/kopia/kopia/) to backup with Ransomware protection (ie. object-lock, retention policy, permission-less apikey). An article is coming.

### Novembre 2024

- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Discovered [DataChain](https://datachain.ai/) that could handle our ML datasets (products, image...)
- <span class="tag">[code]</span> Restarted [MediathequeRoubaix.ts](https://github.com/tomsquest/mediathequeroubaix.ts) and switched to [composable-functions](https://github.com/seasonedcc/composable-functions) (a kind of functional-programming library), using Bun, Biome and LeftHook
- <span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Moved Restic backup from BackBlaze to Scaleway to be billed in euros.<br>Very smooth using `restic copy`
