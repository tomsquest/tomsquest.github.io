<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm a <strong>developer</strong>, and I build <strong>products</strong>.</p>
<p>Since pre-2000, I've been turning lines of code into rewarding creations,
  awkward bugs, and unexpected dance parties when the code finally works!</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Running my own company since 2013</li>
  <li>Founded three startups</li>
  <li>Quick transition from idea to execution — I call it Extreme Pragmatism (Better to have a database in a JSON file than fancy slides)</li>
  <li>Certified in Java, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB, but also Finance</li>
  <li>Beginner in Machine Learning (classification, Learning-to-Rank, Deep learning...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In 1999, my first website was fully designed with HTML tables (didn't know about divs!)</li>
  <li>I enjoy running and riding bicycles in all weather, from -15°C to 40°C</li>
  <li>As a minimalist, I've been running in zero drop shoes since 2008 (proud owner of Xero shoes)</li>
</ul>
