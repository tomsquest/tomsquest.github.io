<h2>2024</h2>

<h3>December 2024</h3>

<ul>
  <li><span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Switched from FreshRss to <a href="https://miniflux.net/">Miniflux</a>, because the responsive part of FreshRss never worked well</li>
  <li><span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Tried <a href="https://github.com/kopia/kopia/">Kopia</a> to backup with Ransomware protection (ie. object-lock, retention policy, permission-less apikey). An article is coming.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Novembre 2024</h3>

<ul>
  <li><span class="tag">[selfhost]</span> Moved Restic backup from BackBlaze to Scaleway to be billed in euros.<br>Very smooth using `restic copy`</li>
</ul>
